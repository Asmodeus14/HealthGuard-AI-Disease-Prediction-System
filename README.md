# HealthGuard AI - Disease Prediction System 🚑

## Overview
**HealthGuard AI** is a machine learning-powered disease prediction system designed to provide **early risk assessment** for various health conditions, including:

- 🩸 **Diabetes Prediction (Random Forest)**
- 💖 **Heart Disease Prediction (Gradient Boosting)**
- 🧠 **Parkinson's Disease Prediction (SVM)**

This project leverages **machine learning models** trained on medical datasets and provides an easy-to-use **Streamlit web interface** for user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Predicts disease risk based on user input health parameters  
✅ Utilizes optimized ML models for high accuracy  
✅ Simple and interactive **Streamlit** interface  
✅ Easily extendable to more diseases in the future  
✅ Deployed as a **local web application**
